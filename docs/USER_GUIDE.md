# User guide — Supertext Translation for Shopify

How to translate your shop's texts with Supertext AI. You need an administrator to have installed the app and entered the Supertext API key (see the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md)).

## Translate

1. In the Shopify admin, open **Apps → Supertext Translation**. The app has two pages, **Translate** and **Settings**: on a computer they are listed under the app in the left sidebar; on a phone, use the **Settings** link at the top of the translate page.
2. **Choose what to translate:** click **Products**, **Collections**, **Pages**, **Blog posts** or **Blogs**, then tick the items. **Select all on this page** ticks the 50 items shown; use **Next page** for more. Only the items on the current page are translated at once.
3. **Choose the languages:** all your shop's other languages are ticked; untick the ones you don't want. Next to each language you see the variant Supertext translates into, for example *→ Supertext de-CH* (an administrator sets it under Settings → Languages). Languages without a choice use Supertext's suggestion (for example `de` → `de-DE`). A language marked *no Supertext language* (for example `en-IE`) can't be ticked until an administrator chooses one there.
4. Leave **Overwrite existing translations** off unless you want to replace translations made earlier (see below).
5. Click **Translate … with Supertext**.

The translation runs in the background. **Recent translations** shows *Translating… 3 of 10* and updates itself; you can leave the page and come back. When it says **Done**, the translations are saved in Shopify.

Each item is translated into one language after the other, so a large selection takes a few minutes.

The app's screens are shown in your Shopify admin language (English, German, French or Italian; English for other languages).

## Review and edit

The translations are saved in Shopify's own translation store, the same place Shopify's free **Translate & Adapt** app uses. To check or correct them:

1. Install Shopify's Translate & Adapt app if you haven't (Apps → search "Translate & Adapt").
2. Open it, pick the language and the item, and edit any field. Your edits are kept until you translate that item again with *Overwrite existing translations*.

Customers see a language only once it is published under **Settings → Languages**.

## Translating again

- **Without** *Overwrite existing translations*, fields that already have a translation are kept. Recent translations shows them as *kept*.
- Fields whose original text changed after they were translated are marked outdated by Shopify. These are always translated again, so a run without overwrite brings your translations up to date.
- **With** *Overwrite existing translations*, every selected field is translated again, replacing edits you made in Translate & Adapt.

## Translation files: export for translation, import translation

Instead of Supertext AI, you can have an item translated by someone else: a translator, a translation tool (Trados, memoQ, Phrase and other CAT tools) or Supertext's web app. The app exports the item's texts as a file and imports the translated file again. Both are on the **Translate** page, below the translate button.

**Export for translation**

1. Under *1. Choose what to translate*, tick exactly **one** item.
2. Under **Export for translation**, choose the **File format**:
   - **XLIFF 1.2 (for translation tools)**: the better choice for translators and translation tools. Formatting (bold, links, …) shows as tags they can move but not break. One file can hold several languages.
   - **HTML (one language per file)**: for Supertext's web app or anyone who translates HTML files.
3. Choose the target languages (HTML: one). Every shop language is offered, also one without a Supertext language: the file then names the Shopify code (for example `en-IE`).
4. Click **Download file**. The file is called like `shopify-8123456789-fr-FR.xlf` (item number and target language; `shopify-8123456789.xlf` for several languages).

The file holds the same fields Supertext AI would translate (see below), also those that already have a translation. Send it to the translator or upload it to Supertext's web app. Translators must keep the file's structure: in an HTML file, leave the head (the `supertext:` lines) and the `data-st-id` attributes alone.

**Import translation**

1. Under **Import translation**, choose the translated file (**Translated file (XLIFF or HTML)**, at most 10 MB).
2. Leave **Also import texts whose source changed since the export** off unless you want translations of texts that were edited in the meantime (they then translate the old text).
3. **Overwrite existing translations** works as for Supertext AI: off, fields that already have a current translation are kept.
4. Click **Import translation**. The translations are saved in Shopify straight away, like Supertext's (you can review them in Translate & Adapt).

The app then shows, per item and language:

| Line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Imported: 3* | Fields saved in Shopify. |
| *Skipped, source changed since the export: 1* | The field's original text was edited after the export, so the translation may be out of date. Import again with *Also import texts whose source changed since the export* to save it anyway, or export again. |
| *Not translated in the file: 1* | The file has no translation for it (XLIFF only). |
| *Formatting changed, not imported: 1* | The translation breaks or adds formatting (tags, links) that the original doesn't have. Fix it in the file and import again. |
| *Not in the file: 1* | The field was added or filled after the export. |
| *Kept, already translated: 1* | The field has a current translation and *Overwrite existing translations* was off. |

An HTML file can't mark a text as untranslated: imported unchanged, it saves the original text as the translation.

Messages: *This file isn't a valid XLIFF or HTML translation file* (damaged, or another kind of file), *This file wasn't exported by the Supertext app, or its header was removed* (the metadata is missing), *This file belongs to another system* (exported from another Supertext plugin), *The item this file was exported from no longer exists*, *The shop has no language …* (the language was removed since), *The file is too large (at most 10 MB)*, *Nothing to translate* (the item has no text fields to export).

## What gets translated

For products, collections, pages, blog posts and blogs, every text field Shopify offers for translation, for example:

- Title and description (the description keeps its headings, lists, bold text, links and images)
- SEO title and SEO description
- Product type, blog post summary and other plain-text fields

## What is not translated

- **URL handles** (the part of the address like `/products/swiss-chocolate`). Set them per language in Translate & Adapt if you want translated addresses.
- Product options and variants, metafields, menus, theme texts, notifications, policies and checkout texts (planned for later versions).
- Images and their alt texts.
- Fields that are empty in the default language.

## Formal and informal language

An administrator chooses under **Settings → Form of address** whether Supertext uses the formal ("Sie") or informal ("du") form. It is applied only to languages that have one; English, for example, is translated without a preference.

## When something goes wrong

Errors appear in red under the translation in **Recent translations**, with the language they concern. One failed item doesn't stop the others.

| Message | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Done, with errors* | Some items were translated, others not. The red lines say why; translate those again. |
| *"en-IE" has no Supertext language, so nothing was sent* | The language has no Supertext language and no default. Ask your administrator to choose one in its list in this app under Settings → Languages (e.g. `en-GB` for `en-IE`), then translate again. Other languages of the same run are translated. |
| *Supertext doesn't translate from "en" into "…"* | Supertext refuses this language pair. Ask your administrator to choose another Supertext language under Settings → Languages. |
| *Interrupted by an app update* | The app was updated while your translation ran. Start it again; finished items are kept. |
| *The item no longer exists* | It was deleted after you selected it. |
| *Supertext returned 2 of 3 fields* | Supertext's answer was incomplete, so nothing was saved for that item. Translate it again. |
| *Authentication failed …* | The API key is wrong. Ask your administrator to check Settings. |
| *Your Supertext translation limit is exceeded* | The Supertext plan's limit is used up. Ask your administrator. |
| *No Supertext API key yet* | Ask your administrator to add it under Settings. |
